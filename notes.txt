 - this is a result of an attempt to split some functionality for an angular js timer interface into its own module

 - some steps:
   - npm install requirejs
   - npm install karma-jasmine
   - npm install sinon

   - setup karma jasmine config
   - setup test-main.js 

   - setup bower package
   - publish it (locally)
